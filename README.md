This Python script allows control of Jandy Aqualink pools with remotes
via a web interface.  Your existing setup needs to already have the 
old-style square remote or SpaLink installed.

You will need a USB RS485 interface, a Raspberry Pi, and either a wireless
or wired connection to your home network.

It emulates a LCD controller and a SpaLink control panel on the web
interface as well as the RS485 bus.

# SpaLink Web Interface

Install and run it from /etc/local.rc on a RaspberryPi and go to:
* LCD Controller:  http://raspi/
* SpaLink:         http://raspi/spa.html
(where raspi is replaced with your RaspberryPi's IP or hostname)

There is no authentication, so anyone with access to your network has
**unrestricted access**.

Some of the RS485 protocol routine was borrowed from

and some code on the excellent Trouble Free Pool forums:
